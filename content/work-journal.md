### Week of May 3 - May 9, 2021

**ðŸ’» Work**
- Created this work journal page! I realized it is an excellent complement to my #66DaysofData tweets. [Link](https://twitter.com/search?lang=pt&q=(%2366DaysofData)%20(from%3Ahmatalonga)&src=typed_query)
- I did some writing on my master thesis. To keep up with the schedule.
- I published a blog post about the Titanic dataset.

**ðŸ“š Learnings**
- I have been learning about different methods of comparing datasets. While there are a few more commonly used, there is no one solution that fits all kinds of data distributions. In my particular case, I have two groups of non-normal data distributions with continuous numerical features. After doing some research, I selected the following options: Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests. And I will also use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and relative entropy.

**ðŸ’¡ Interesting stuff**
- Kaggle released a new feature that allows sharing of notebooks. [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/230748)
- Emerging Architectures for Modern Data Infrastructure. [Link](https://a16z.com/2020/10/15/the-emerging-architectures-for-modern-data-infrastructure/)
- Repository about Data Science in Production. [Link](https://github.com/eugeneyan/applied-ml)
