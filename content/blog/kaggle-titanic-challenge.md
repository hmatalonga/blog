Empower your NuxtJS application with `@nuxtjs/content` module: write in a `content/` directory and fetch your Markdown, JSON, YAML and CSV files through a MongoDB like API, acting as a **Git-based Headless CMS**.

## Writing content

Learn how to write your `content/`, supporting Markdown, YAML, CSV and JSON: https://content.nuxtjs.org/writing.

## Fetching content

Learn how to fetch your content with `$content`: https://content.nuxtjs.org/fetching.

## Displaying content

Learn how to display your Markdown content with the `<nuxt-content>` component directly in your template: https://content.nuxtjs.org/displaying.

```javascript
export default {
  async asyncData({ $content, params, error }) {
    const slug = params.slug || "index";
    const page = await $content(slug)
      .fetch()
      .catch(err => {
        error({ statusCode: 404, message: "Page not found" });
      });

    return {
      page
    };
  }
};
```
