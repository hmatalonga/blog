If you are anything like me, you consume tons of information every day. Over time, I built the habit of saving the most valuable things in someplace, like a note-taking app to read them later.
But the problem is that I realized despite saving all these kinds of information, I would often forget what I had saved and why I did it at that time. There was a missing link between all those resources.

Then recently, I stumbled upon a [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/96pSnIo4nDg) talking about the idea of building a second brain, a system designed to organize our knowledge. It got me pretty excited about the notion of having a systematic approach that would help me relate these bits of information with each other. If, together, I could put them to better use in the future when I needed them. So, I started to research more about it.

## What is Building a Second Brain?

From [this article](https://fortelabs.co/blog/basboverview/) of Tiago Forte, author of the course Building a Second Brain, here is how he illustrates the concept:

> Building A Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we‚Äôve gained through our experience. It expands our memory and our intellect using the modern tools of technology and networks.

> This methodology is not only for preserving those ideas, but turning them into reality. It provides a clear, actionable path to creating a ‚Äúsecond brain‚Äù ‚Äì an external, centralized, digital repository for the things you learn and the resources from which they come.

Therefore, you can imagine a Second Brain as a place to store the relevant information curated for yourself and organized in a connected way.

## Why Building a Second Brain?

Here are some of the reasons why building a Second Brain can be beneficial:
- **Investing in your Future Memory** - Keep things to use them later.
- **Information Overload** - We can't remember everything we read, and there is too much noise. Keep what matters to you.

## How to Build a Second Brain?

Use any note-taking app. I use *Notion*, but there are plenty of options like *Evernote*, *Roam Research*, *RemNote*, *Obsidian*, to name a few. You pick the one that you like the most.
